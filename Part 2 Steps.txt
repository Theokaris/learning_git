## Git and Github Tutorial

This is from the second video of the git and github tutorial series


1. When a new document is added to the folder. When the status is checked using "git status", it displays this new document as untracked. If it is renamed, it says it's renamed, if it's deleted it says it's deleted. If modified it says modified.
 

2. We can acknoledge the new documnet using the "git add ."


3. We could unstage it we can any of the following two methods

i. git restore --staged "file name" or git restore --staged . (unstage every file)

ii git reset "file name" or git reset --staged . (unstage every file)

4. git diff --staged shows number of changes made but that are not yet committed

5. To create a new branch you use "git branch 'branch name"

6. To change from main to new branch use "git branch checkout 'branch name'

7. You use merge to connect your new branch to your main branch
